<!--
Difference between id and class:

Classes can be applied to multiple HTML elements, and HTML elements can
have multiple calsses applied to them; whereas each HTML element can only
have one ID and multiple HTML elements should not have the same ID.
It's /probably/ better to use classes over IDs unless you are absolutely, 
positively sure that there will only be exactly one of a given element. 
For the most part, anything you can do with id you can also do with class.
