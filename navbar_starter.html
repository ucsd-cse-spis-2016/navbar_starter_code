<!--
Difference between id and class:

Classes can be applied to multiple HTML elements, and HTML elements can
have multiple calsses applied to them; whereas each HTML element can only
have one ID and multiple HTML elements should not have the same ID.
It's /probably/ better to use classes over IDs unless you are absolutely, 
positively sure that there will only be exactly one of a given element. 
For the most part, anything you can do with id you can also do with class,
especially when using CSS. When dealing with JavaScript, you'll find it
easier to get elements by their IDs, and luckily an element can have an id
in addition to having classes.

    <head>
        <!--- this area holds all the metadata; telling the browser the title of the page, etc --->
        <!--- it is also where you place all you css and javascript files  --->
                
    </head>

    <body>
    
        <!--- this is where most of the content for your page is found --->
    
        
        <footer>
            <!--- this part of the html file is often used for content found at the bottom of a page --->
        </footer>
    </body>
